# Basic Terminologies

At its very core, each *project* that you embark on has its dedicated **Board**.

A board is simply a visual interface that you can share with other **members**. Each board contains a collection of **tasks** and each task gets its own **state**. A state specifies the stage that the task is currently at, and you can create new states depending on your workflow lifecycle. What's more, you can specify tags for each task for greater granularity in managing your work.
